Part B:
i) Integration of 1/sqrt(x) from 0 to 1. (Note I used delta=1e-4 and epsilon=1e-4)
The analytic result is 2.
The calculated result without transformation is 1.99999738796403 with 17140 evaluations.
The calculated result with CC-transformation is 1.9999998903107 with 52 evaluations

ii) Integration of ln/sqrt(1-x*x) from 0 to 1. (Note I used delta=1e-4 and epsilon=1e-4)
The analytic result is -4.
The calculated result without transformation is -3.99999834899021 with 29972 evaluations.
The calculated result with CC-transformation is -3.99999813339603 with 272 evaluations

The CC-transformation seems to lower the number of needed evalutaions significant.

iii) Integrate 4/(1-xÂ²) from 0 to 1. Unless I set a limit on the number of elaluations of the integrator, both methods can find a pracition close to the machine epsilon. Calculated without CC: 3.14159265358979, with CC: 3.14159265358979, and analytic Pi: 3.14159265358979.

In plotB.svg the accuracy and number of evaluations is compared for my integrator the CC-model and o8av from matlib/integration
o8av is significant faster.
